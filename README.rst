python-gringo
=============

Download, activate the virtualenv of your choice, then::

  python2 setup.py sdist
  pip2 install dist/gringo-*.tar.gz

This solution includes the whole clingo source [1]_. It should be fairly simple
to swap in a new version, just be sure to set up build/release.py correctly.

There is an exemple of release.py that compile clingo with multithread (TBB is downloadable manually [2]_ if not in your repository) and python2.7 support::

  CXX = 'g++'
  CXXFLAGS = ['-std=c++11', '-O3', '-Wall']
  CPPPATH = ['/usr/include/python2.7', '/path/to/tbb/tbb43_20150316oss/include']
  # path depends of your system.
  CPPDEFINES = {'NDEBUG': 1}
  LIBS = ['dl']
  LIBPATH = ['/path/to/tbb/tbb43_20150316oss/lib/intel64/gcc4.4']
  LINKFLAGS = ['-std=c++11', '-O3']
  RPATH = []
  AR = 'ar'
  ARFLAGS = ['rc']
  RANLIB = 'ranlib'
  BISON = 'bison'
  RE2C = 're2c'
  WITH_PYTHON = 'python2.7'
  WITH_LUA = 'auto'
  WITH_TBB = 'tbb'
  WITH_CPPUNIT = 'auto'
